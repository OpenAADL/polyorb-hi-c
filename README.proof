The PolyORB/HI-C runtime can be proved using deductive methods. To do
so, install the following softwares:

  - OPAM, an OCaml package manager (see http://opam.ocamlpro.com/)
  - Alt-Ergo, Frama-C and Why/Why3 using opam with the following
    command:

    opam install alt-ergo frama-c why

You can then prove the PolyORB/HI-C runtime using the prove target in
the Makefile.
