-- Next example exploits the AADL execution model to compute a speed by 
-- counting the number of ticks received each second by the measuring thread. 
-- The event port queue acts as a persistent count. At each periodic 
-- dispatch, all events received during the previous period are transferred 
-- to a thread local queue (implemented as counter) and become available to 
-- the user. At that time the event port queue is reset to empty (count 
-- zero). The Dequeue_Protocol of AllItems specifies that all events are to 
-- be removed from the event port queue.
