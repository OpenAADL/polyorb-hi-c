"ping_overflow" example:
---------------

* Description: two threads ping two ports of another thread periodically, you
  can observe after a while some pings dropped when the fifo is full (set
  Verbosity to Verbose in PolyORB_HI-output to get more details). The first
  port has a higher Urgency so we only get the first thread pings (Value + 1),
  change Urgency of the pinged thread ports (thread Q) to change the received
  pings.

* One deployment is provided 
  1. ping-local deploys one node, the three threads are on the same node.

* The AADL model used is conform to AADLv2

* Compilation: issue "make" in the root directory

* Execution: launch node_a for the local case
