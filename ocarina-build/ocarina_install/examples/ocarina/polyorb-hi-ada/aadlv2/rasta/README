This example shows how to integrate multiple drivers with PolyORB-HI/Ada. 

It relies on native Linuw and/or the GR_CPCI_X4CV RASTA board.

The makefile generates different configurations, based on different
scenarios:

* demo_full : this setting assumes one RASTA board, with SpaceWire
  core #1 connected to SpaceWire core #2, and UART DSU #1 connected to
  UART DSU #2.
   
* demo_spw : this setting assumes one RASTA board, with SpaceWire core
  #1 connected to SpaceWire core #2.

* demo_uart: this setting assumes one RASTA board, with UART DSU #1
  connected to UART DSU #2.

Note: demo_full, demo_spw, demo_uart are to be run on a RASTA board.
