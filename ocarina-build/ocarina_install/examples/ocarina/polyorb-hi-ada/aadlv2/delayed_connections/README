"delayed connections" example:
------------------------------

* Description: One periodic thread sends information to another
  periodic thread. The second thread is twice faster than the first
  one.

  The sender sends two messages to the receiver, the first (N_Cycle)
  through an immediate connection and the second (Data_Source),
  through a delayer connection. If this latter connection was
  immediate, the receiver would receive a value of Data_Source which
  would be equal to N_Cycle. Because the connection is delayed, the
  receiver sees only the previous value of Data_Source which is equal
  to N_Cycle - 1.

* Compilation: issue "make build-all" in the root directory

* Run: launch node_a
