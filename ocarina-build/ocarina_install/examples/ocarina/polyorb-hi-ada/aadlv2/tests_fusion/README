Fusion examples. 

Tests fusion of thread at architectural and code generation levels.

This test directory contains different scripts for testing and 
evaluation purpose :

- load_file_list : Ocarina script : make each examples in a given
test to be concatened in a single, stand-alone AADL file.

- single_fusion.sh : Ocarina script : fusion 2 threads from a given 
concatened example.

- testall.sh : shell script : call load_file_list and single_fusion.sh
on each tests. Used in order to test architectural-level thread fusion.

- compile_all.sh : shell script : compile each tests, expecting a 
concatened fusioned AADL file. Used in order to test code generation-
level thread fusion

- analyze.sh : shell script : use size, ocarina-boundt and boundt 
in order to evaluate a concatened model performances, and write the 
result back into an annotated AADL model. Not used by the build-all 
make commande.

- analyze_all.sh : shell script : evaluate both not fusioned and 
fusioned threads, building correpsonding annotated models. Uses 
analyze.sh. Not used by the build-all 
make commande.
