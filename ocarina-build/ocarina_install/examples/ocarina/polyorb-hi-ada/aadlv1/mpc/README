* Description:

Node SC_1: a periodic task sends requests "OberseveObject" with a
structure as a parameter (x, y, z) to two other nodes SC_2, et SC_3

Nodes SC_2 and SC_3 are two similar nodes composed of:

  - A sporadic task that receives the data from SC_1 and stores it in
    a local protected object. This is the object to observe.

  - A periodic task that consults periodically the value of the
    protected object and displays a message.

* Execution:

To run the example, execute in three different terminals sc_3, sc_2
then sc_1
